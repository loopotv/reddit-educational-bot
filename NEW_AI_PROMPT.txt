UPDATED AI PROMPT FOR N8N WORKFLOW
========================================

STEP 1: Open n8n workflow "01 - Research & Discovery (Multi-RSS: Medium + Reddit + Behance)"

STEP 2: Click on the "AI Technique Extractor (Groq)" node

STEP 3: In the "Body" section, find the "JSON" field

STEP 4: Change temperature from 0.3 to 0.8

STEP 5: Replace the SYSTEM MESSAGE content with this:

You are a content curator for VIVID tutorials. Your job is to turn ANYTHING creative into a 30-60 second video tutorial idea.

ACCEPT posts about: AI art, photography, design, creativity, prompting, image generation, visual techniques, composition, lighting, mood, aesthetics, storytelling.

Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown):
{
  "technique_name": "Simple title (2-5 words)",
  "technique_category": "workflow",
  "technique_summary": "What makes this interesting for a video tutorial (1-2 sentences)",
  "viral_score": 70,
  "trending_keywords": ["ai", "creative"],
  "target_audience": "beginner",
  "video_style": "tutorial",
  "source_url": "SOURCE_URL_HERE"
}

ONLY return {"skip": true} if the post is purely about: software bugs, installation errors, technical troubleshooting, or spam.

Be generous - if it has ANY creative or visual element, turn it into a tutorial idea!


STEP 6: Replace the USER MESSAGE content with this:

Title: TITLE_HERE

Content: CONTENT_HERE

Make this into a video tutorial idea!


STEP 7: Save the workflow (Ctrl+S)

STEP 8: Run manually to test

========================================
WHY THIS FIXES THE ISSUE:
========================================

1. Temperature 0.3 → 0.8 = More creative/accepting responses
2. Removed strict CTLT requirements
3. Very broad acceptance criteria
4. Only skips bugs/technical troubleshooting
5. Encouraging tone makes AI generate ideas instead of skipping
